## Course description
This intermediate-level course provides a comprehensive study of the Java programming language. Key topics include single- and multidimensional arrays, objects and classes, and the principles of object-oriented programming. Students will explore inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and text input/output (I/O). Additional areas of focus include abstract classes, interfaces, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), recursion, concurrency, and generic collections with data structures such as linked lists, queues, and stacks.

The course is designed for students majoring in computer and information sciences, as well as anyone interested in deepening their understanding of Java programming.

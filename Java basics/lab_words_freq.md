# Lab: Words frequencies

## Objectives
Count number of words

## Pre-requisite
Review of the week 1 Java contents

## Tasks
Define a method named getWordFrequency that takes an array of strings, the size of the array, and a search word as parameters. 
Method getWordFrequency() then returns the number of occurrences of the search word in the array parameter (case insensitive). 
Then, write a main program that reads a list of words into an array, calls method getWordFrequency() repeatedly, and outputs the words 
in the arrays with their frequencies. Assume that the list will always contain less than 20 words.

The program must define and call a method:
```public static int getWordFrequency(String[] wordsList, int listSize, String currWord)```

## Example input
hey Hi Mark hi mark

## Example output
hey 1  
Hi 2    
Mark 2   
hi 2   
mark 2   

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful.
However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks)
2. Explain how you will perform a frequency analysis of a website if you have to do it. (1 mark)
3. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (1 mark)
4. Create a video explaining how the code works. The video should show your face on one side of the screen preferably the top or bottom right of the screen. (1 mark)
5. Upload the working code. (6 marks)

## How to submit it?
Upload your work as a Markdown file to your GitHub account and share the link on Canvas. Please review the guide:"

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks)
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks)
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)

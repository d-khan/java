# Syllabus (CISC-191 Intermediate Java Programming) Honors Contract

__This syllabus is for Honors Contract Students only.__

## Welcome to the course!
My name is Dr. Danish Khan, and I am excited to begin this educational journey with all of you! Together, we will create a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone’s ideas are valued and respected. Your active participation will enrich our learning community, and I look forward to getting to know each of you. Let’s make this school year a meaningful experience filled with growth, learning, and lasting positive memories!

## Course description
This intermediate-level course provides a comprehensive study of the Java programming language. Key topics include single- and multidimensional arrays, objects and classes, and the principles of object-oriented programming. Students will explore inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and text input/output (I/O). Additional areas of focus include abstract classes, interfaces, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), recursion, concurrency, and generic collections with data structures such as linked lists, queues, and stacks.

The students enrolled in the Honors Contract are expected to do independent research, extra assignments, and 1:1 meetings with the professor. The student will be involved in Work-Based Learning activities in which students get in touch with career services, improve resume writing and interviewing skills, and get in touch with professionals in the relevant field.

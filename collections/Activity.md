# Activity: Collections

## Objective

Identify palindrome and implement using deque 

## Pre-requisite

Review the "Collections" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. Write a code which uses deque and tests whether a line of text is a palindrome. 
The program reads a line, then outputs whether the input is a palindrome or not.

__Expected input__

civic

__Expected output__

Yes, civic is a palindrome.

__Expected input__

rotostor

__Expected output__

No, "rotostor" is not a palindrome.

>**Note:** Ignore punctuation and spacing. Assume all alphabetic characters are lowercase.
>
>Special case: A one-character string is a palindrome.
>
>Hint: The deque must be a Deque of Characters, but ordinary chars will be automatically converted to Characters when added to the deque.

## What to submit?
  
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 marks).  
3. Create a video explaining how the code works. The video should show your face on one side of the screen preferably the top or bottom right of the screen. (1 mark)
4. Upload the working code. (5 marks)

## How to submit it?
Upload your work as a Markdown file to your GitHub account and share the link on Canvas. Please review the guide:"
[Submitting your assignments using Github](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/share/SVvlngcEn-7CaNI8FvwEVJ5ulLp4sxpqN9hnCYvXeHHcls2e0TBlU47uATNklUf-.yX4fsJjsU2nuLGeX?startTime=1725121532000)"

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)

# Change contents in a text file

## Objective
Understand how to edit contents in a text file

## Pre-requisite
Review "Input and output"

## Task
A photographer is organizing a photo collection about the national parks in the US and would like to annotate the information about each of the photos into a separate set of files. Write a program that reads the name of a text file containing a list of photo file names. The program then reads the photo file names from the text file, replaces the "_photo.jpg" portion of the file names with "_info.txt", and outputs the modified file names.

Assume the unchanged portion of the photo file names contains only letters and numbers, and the text file stores one photo file name per line. If the text file is empty, the program produces no output.

## Expected input
ParkPhotos.txt
and the contents of ParkPhotos.txt are:
```
Acadia2003_photo.jpg
AmericanSamoa1989_photo.jpg
BlackCanyonoftheGunnison1983_photo.jpg
CarlsbadCaverns2010_photo.jpg
CraterLake1996_photo.jpg
GrandCanyon1996_photo.jpg
IndianaDunes1987_photo.jpg
LakeClark2009_photo.jpg
Redwood1980_photo.jpg
VirginIslands2007_photo.jpg
Voyageurs2006_photo.jpg
WrangellStElias1987_photo.jpg
```

## Expected output
```
Acadia2003_info.txt
AmericanSamoa1989_info.txt
BlackCanyonoftheGunnison1983_info.txt
CarlsbadCaverns2010_info.txt
CraterLake1996_info.txt
GrandCanyon1996_info.txt
IndianaDunes1987_info.txt
LakeClark2009_info.txt
Redwood1980_info.txt
VirginIslands2007_info.txt
Voyageurs2006_info.txt
WrangellStElias1987_info.txt
```

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 mark).  
3. Create a video explaining how the code works. The video should show your face on one side of the screen preferably the top or bottom right of the screen. (1 mark)
4. Upload the working code. (5 marks)

## How to submit it?
Upload your work as a Markdown file to your GitHub account and share the link on Canvas. Please review the guide:"
[Submitting your assignments using Github](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/share/SVvlngcEn-7CaNI8FvwEVJ5ulLp4sxpqN9hnCYvXeHHcls2e0TBlU47uATNklUf-.yX4fsJjsU2nuLGeX?startTime=1725121532000)"

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)

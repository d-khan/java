# Overriding methods

## Objective
Understand how to use overriding methods.

## Pre-requisite
Review the "Inheritance" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task
- Write main() and a base `Book` class, define a derived class called `Encyclopedia` with member methods to get and set private fields of the following types:

  - String to store the edition
  - int to store the number of pages

  Within the derived `Encyclopedia` class, define a printInfo() method that overrides the `Book` class' printInfo() method by printing the title, author, publisher, publication date, edition, and number of pages.

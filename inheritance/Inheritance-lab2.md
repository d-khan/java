# Derived classes

## Objective
Use inheritance to store user data.

## Pre-requisite
Review the "Inheritance" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task
Write `main()`, define a `Course` base class with methods to set and get private fields of the following types:

- String to store the course number
- String to store the course title

Define `Course`'s PrintInfo() method that outputs the course number and title.

Then, define a derived class `OfferedCourse` with methods to set and get private fields of the following types:

- String to store the instructor's name
- String to store the location
- String to store the class time

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 marks).  
3. Create a video explaining how the code works. The video should show your face on one side of the screen preferably the top or bottom right of the screen. (1 mark)
4. Upload the working code. (5 marks)

## How to submit it?
Upload your work as a Markdown file to your GitHub account and share the link on Canvas. Please review the guide:"

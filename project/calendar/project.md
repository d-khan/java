# Meeting scheduler

## Objective

Create a meeting scheduler that allows users to display schedules or set meetings for specific days and times.

## Description

The user will interact with the scheduler through a GUI, which will include a calendar feature. This feature will display a calendar based on user input such as the month and the year or just simply the year. The user
will input the description on the selected date and time. The user should able to display the current schedule.

## What do you need to perform this task?

Knowledge of SQL and use JConnector to access SQL from JVM

Review of GUI lecture

Review SQL cheat sheet

## Task

1. Display a calendar based on user input. For example, when the user inputs a year, all the months along with their dates and days of the week should be displayed. [Visit the link to see the output example](https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/project/calendar/full-year-calendar-2020.png). **(5 marks)**

2. Users should be able to select a date and time to set their schedule. There should be options to either "Create a New Schedule" or "View Current Schedule." When setting up or accessing the current schedule, it is necessary to use JConnector to connect to the SQL database. Make sure that the database, data types, and tables have been created correctly. Under Java, use SQL queries to display the current schedule or to set a new schedule. The scheduling data will be stored in the database. **(5 marks)**

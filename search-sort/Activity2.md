# Activity: Merge sort

## Objective

Write a code and implement merge sort

## Pre-requisite

Review the [Search and sort lecture](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/search-sort/Lecture.html)

## Task
- Read the size of an integer array, followed by the elements of the array (no duplicates).
- Output the array.
- Perform an merge sort on the array.
- Output the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

__Expected input__

`6 3 2 1 5 9 8`

__Expected output__

```
unsorted: 3 2 1 5 9 8

sorted:   1 2 3 5 8 9
comparisons: 8
```

## What to submit?
  
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 marks).  
3. Create a video explaining how the code works. The video should show your face on one side of the screen preferably the top or bottom right of the screen. (1 mark)
4. Upload the working code. (5 marks)

## How to submit it?

Upload your work to your Github account and share the link on Canvas.

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)

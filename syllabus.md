Students who are found to be in violation of Administrative Procedure 3100.3, Honest Academic Conduct, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment in question and may be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with Administrative Procedure 3100.2, Student Disciplinary Procedures.  

Plagiarism — to take and pass off as one’s own work or ideas of another — is a form of academic dishonesty.
Plagiarism is any one of the following: 
- Verbatim copying without proper acknowledgment on term papers, homework or tests/exams;
- Paraphrasing without proper acknowledgment;
- Putting together a “patchwork” paper from diverse sources, without proper acknowledgment of those sources;
- Unacknowledged appropriation of information or of someone else’s ideas.

Acts of plagiarism will result in no credit awarded for the assignment; remedial instruction; academic or
administrative sanctions; and/or other consequences. 

> The Honest Academic Conduct policy can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 5500, Student Rights, Responsibilities, Campus Safety and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at:

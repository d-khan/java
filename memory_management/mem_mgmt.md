# Memory management

## Objective
Understand how memory management works in Java

## Pre-requisite
Review "Memory management"

## Task A (using classes)
Create your own class which performs a certain task. Use main() to create an object of the class. You can also use any past object and classes
examples.

## Expected output
The code and the mapping of each variable and object into "Stack and Heap". Make sure to show how garbage collector works on the code.
You can draw "Stack and Heap" on paper or on a computer. Your choice.

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 mark).  
3. Create a video explaining how the code works. The video should show your face on one side of the screen preferably the top or bottom right of the screen. (1 mark)
4. Upload the working code. (5 marks)

## How to submit it?
Upload your work as a Markdown file to your GitHub account and share the link on Canvas. Please review the guide:"

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)

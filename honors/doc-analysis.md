# Lab: Document analysis (Honors contract)

## Objectives
Parse the document

## Tasks
Your job is to write a program that takes a file in .txt format and counts the number of English words that appear in the document. The output should be saved in another text file. For example, the file has the following contents:

Use well the days,
Use well the days...
Turn your face to the green world,
Use well the days.

The example output will be something like this:

Use:2
well:3

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks)
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (1 mark)
3. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. (6 marks)

## How to submit it?
Upload your work in the .pdf format and clearly define your responses. Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java extension.

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks)
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks)
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)

__Use Well the Days__

Around the corner there may wait
A new road or a secret gate,
And though I have passed them by,
A day will come...
I will take the hidden paths that run
West of the moon, and East of the sun.
I'm glad that you are here with me,
Here at the end of all things.

Night, too, shall be beautiful,
And blessed, and its fear will pass.
I must leave, must cross this sea;
The love you gave is all I take with me.

Use well the days,
Use well the days...
Turn your face to the green world,
Use well the days.

Seven stars and seven stones
And one White Tree,
From all the sundered seas...

Use well the days,
Use well the days...
Turn your face to the green world.
Use well the days.
